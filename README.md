# camera-app
Basic website I built to practice using Tesseract to make OCR technology.
Using this website, you can take a picture of text, and the software will identify it from the picture.

Things I learned:
1. How to use Tesseract to create an OCR application.
2. How to add a camera to an HTML page.
